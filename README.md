# Port-a-panel
A portable monitor enclosure using the AU Optronics B156XW04 panel and an aftermarket driver board

## The story
After getting a monitor for my desk I realised that having a dual monitor setup for my laptop is a no-brainer for any sort of productivity.
Since I'm a laptop guy and I travel or work away from home a lot I wanted to be able to have that luxury wherever I go. Looking around, portable monitors seemed to be out of my budget (starting from around 100$). I had a spare laptop panel laying around and I thought to myself: "Why not make my own portable monitor?". And so I did. I took apart an old HP Pavillion 15 and took out the panel. It's only 1366x768 and the viewing angles are pretty bad but it does the job. 
In this repo you can find all the 3D Models I made for the panel and the driver board, as well as some resources I used for reference. I'm not sure how useful this will be for other people but it can probably be adapted to fit other panels with little effort since I'm trying to make it as parametric as possible.

## Parts
- AU Optronics B156XW04 panel (I used a v5 pane from an HP Pavillion 15-b003ev)
- Driver board (make sure it's compatible with the panel and particular revision you have) I used [this one](https://www.ebay.com/itm/384518789920) from ebay which has VGA, HDMI, RCA and USB media inputs as well as an analog TV tuner which I won't be using.
- Assorted screws (TBD)
- Magnets (TBD)


## Resources
- Inspiration from this project came mostly from some of DIY Perks' videos, you should definitely check out his channel, he makes some insane projects.
	This project is very loosely based on

	- [Build a DIY screen out of recycled parts of cheap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfirQC99xPc)
- Also consulted the Datasheet for the panel which I found [here](https://datasheetspdf.com/datasheet/B156XW04-V5.html). Also available in this repo as [B156XW04-V5-datasheet.pdf](/B156XW04-V5-datasheet.pdf])
